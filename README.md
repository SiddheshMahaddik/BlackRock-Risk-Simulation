Active vs. Passive Management: Analysis of revenue generation from active (26% of AUM) and passive (74% of AUM) strategies.
Management Fees: Examination of fixed and performance-linked management fees as major revenue components.

Risk Management Analysis
Market Risk: Includes simulations of AUM fluctuations based on market volatility, using Monte Carlo simulations and stress testing methodologies.
Client Redemption and Liquidity Risk: Assessing the impact of significant client withdrawals and strategies for maintaining liquidity.
Foreign Exchange Risk: Evaluation of earnings sensitivity to currency fluctuations across BlackRock’s global operations.

Simulation and Quantification
Monte Carlo Simulation: Utilized to simulate AUM paths and assess the potential impacts of market risks on AUM and revenues.
Stress Testing: Application of extreme market conditions to test the robustness of BlackRock's financial structure.
Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR): Metrics used to quantify potential losses in adverse market conditions.

Key Findings
Market volatility and investor redemptions are critical factors that can significantly affect BlackRock’s AUM and subsequently, its revenue.
Adequate liquidity buffers and prudent risk management are essential in mitigating sudden redemptions and maintaining financial stability.
